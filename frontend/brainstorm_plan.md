# Brainstorm Plan for Chatbox Visibility Issue in Streamlit App

## Objective
Investigate why the chatbox is not visible in the Streamlit application and propose solutions.

## Steps to Follow

1. **Check Streamlit Version**:
   - Ensure that the Streamlit version is up to date. Some features may not work correctly in older versions.

2. **Inspect Layout Configuration**:
   - Review the layout settings in `st.set_page_config()`. Ensure that the layout is set to "wide" to allow enough space for the chatbox.

3. **Examine Sidebar and Main Layout**:
   - Confirm that the sidebar and main layout are not overlapping or causing the chatbox to be hidden. Adjust the layout if necessary.

4. **Test Chat Input Functionality**:
   - Verify that the `st.chat_input()` function is being called correctly and that there are no errors in the console that might prevent it from rendering.

5. **Check Session State**:
   - Ensure that `st.session_state.messages` is being updated correctly. If there are issues with session state management, it could affect the display of chat messages.

6. **Run Locally**:
   - Run the Streamlit app locally and check the browser console for any errors or warnings that might indicate issues with rendering.

7. **Review CSS/Styling**:
   - If any custom CSS or styling is applied, ensure that it does not inadvertently hide or obscure the chatbox.

8. **Debugging**:
   - Add temporary print statements or Streamlit messages to debug the flow and see if the chat input is being processed correctly.

## Conclusion
By following these steps, we can identify the root cause of the chatbox visibility issue and implement the necessary fixes to ensure it displays correctly in the Streamlit application.
